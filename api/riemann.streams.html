id="content"><h2>riemann.streams documentation</h2><pre class="doc">The streams namespace aims to provide a comprehensive set of widely
applicable, combinable tools for building more complex streams.

Streams are functions which accept events or, in some cases, lists of events.

Streams typically do one or more of the following.

* Filter events.
* Transform events.
* Combine events over time.
* Apply events to other streams.
* Forward events to other services.

Most streams accept, after their initial arguments, any number of streams as
children. These are known as children or &quot;child streams&quot; of the stream.
The children are typically invoked sequentially, any exceptions thrown are
caught, logged and optionally forwarded to *exception-stream*.
Return values of children are ignored.

Events are backed by a map (e.g. {:service &quot;foo&quot; :metric 3.5}), so any
function that accepts maps will work with events.
Common functions like prn can be used as a child stream.

Some common patterns for defining child streams are (fn [e] (println e))
and (partial log :info).</pre><div class="public" id="var-*exception-stream*"><h3>*exception-stream*</h3><div class="usage"></div><pre class="doc">When an exception is caught, it's converted to an event and sent here.

</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-adjust"><h3>adjust</h3><div class="usage"><code>(adjust &amp; args)</code></div><pre class="doc">Passes on a changed version of each event by applying a function to a
particular field or to the event as a whole.

Passing a vector of [field function &amp; args] to adjust will modify the given
field in incoming events by applying the function to it along with the given
arguments.  For example:

(adjust [:service str &quot; rate&quot;] ...)

takes {:service &quot;foo&quot;} and emits {:service &quot;foo rate&quot;}.

If a function is passed to adjust instead of a vector, adjust behaves like
smap: the entire event will be given to the function and the result will be
passed along to the children. For example:

(adjust #(assoc % :metric (count (:tags %))) ...)

takes {:tags [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;]} and emits {:tags [&quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;] :metric 2}.

Prefer (smap f &amp; children) to (adjust f &amp; children) where possible.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-apdex"><h3>apdex</h3><div class="usage"><code>(apdex dt satisfied? tolerated? &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">A stream which computes Apdex metrics every dt seconds for a stream of

is truthy, increments the satisfied count for that time window by 1. If
(tolerated? event) is truthy, increments the tolerated count for that time
window by 1. Any other states are ignored. Every dt seconds (as long as
events are arriving), emits an event with a metric between 0 and 1, derived
by:

(satisfied count + (tolerating count / 2) / total count of received events

Ignores expired events.

</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-by"><h3>by</h3><div class="usage"><code>(by fields &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">Splits stream by field.
Every time an event arrives with a new value of field, this macro invokes
its child forms to return a *new*, distinct set of streams for that
particular value.

(rate 5 prn) prints a single rate for all events, once every five seconds.

(by :host (rate 5) tracks a separate rate for *each host*, and prints each
one every five seconds.

You can pass multiple fields too

(by [:host :service])

Note that field can be a keyword like :host or :state, but you can *also* use
any unary function for more complex sharding.

Be aware that (by) over unbounded values can result in
*many* substreams being created, so you wouldn't want to write
(by metric prn): you'd get a separate prn for *every* unique metric that
came in.  Also, (by) streams are never garbage-collected.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-by-builder"><h3>by-builder</h3><div class="usage"><code>(by-builder [sym fields] &amp; forms)</code></div><pre class="doc">Splits stream by provided function.
This is a variation of `by` where forms are executed when a fork

and removed from the state table thereafter.

Use coalesce to combine states that arrive at different times--for instance,
to average the CPU use over several hosts.

share the same :foo and :bar attributes:

Events without metrics are passed through unchanged. Events with metrics
increment the counter, and are passed on with their metric set to the current
count.

You can reset the counter by passing it an event with a metric, tagged
&quot;reset&quot;; the count will be reset to that metric.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-ddt"><h3>ddt</h3><div class="usage"><code>(ddt &amp; args)</code></div><pre class="doc">Differentiate metrics with respect to time. Takes an optional number

the difference between the current event and the previous one, divided by the
difference in their times. Skips events without metrics.

(exception-stream (email &quot;polito@vonbraun.com&quot;)
  (async-queue! :graphite {:core-pool-size 128}
    graph))

Streams often take multiple children and send an event to each using
call-rescue. Call-rescue will rescue any exception thrown by a child stream,
log it, and move on to the next child stream, so that a failure in one child
won't prevent others from executing.

Exceptions binds a dynamically scoped thread-local variable
*exception-stream*. When call-rescue encounters an exception, it will *also*
route the error to this exception stream. When switching threads (e.g. when
using an executor or Thread), you
must use (bound-fn) to preserve this binding.

This is a little more complex than you might think, because we *not only*
need to bind this variable during the runtime execution of child streams, but
*also* during the evaluation of the child streams themselves, e.g. at the
invocation time of exceptions itself. If we write

(exception-stream (email ...)
  (rate 5 index))

then (rate), when invoked, might need access to this variable immediately.
Therefore, this macro binds *exception-stream* twice: one when evaluating
children, and again, every time the returned stream is invoked.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-execute-on"><h3>execute-on</h3><div class="usage"><code>(execute-on executor &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">Returns a stream which accepts events and executes them using a

recombine those paths after some transformation. Pipe lets you write
these topologies easily.

We might express a linear stream in Riemann, in which a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d, as

(a (b (c d)))

With pipe, we write

(pipe ↧ (a ↧)
        (b ↧)
        (c ↧)
        d)

The first argument ↧ is a *marker* for points where events should flow down
into the next stage. A delightful list of marker symbols you might enjoy is
available at http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/arrows.html.

What makes pipe more powerful than the standard Riemann composition rules is
that the marker may appear *multiple times* in a stage, and *at any depth in
the expression*. For instance, we might want to categorize events based on
their metric, and send all those events into the same throttled email stream.

(let [throttled-emailer (throttle 100 1 (email &quot;ops@rickenbacker.mil&quot;))]
  (splitp &lt; metric
    0.9 (with :state :critical throttled-emailer)
    0.5 (with :state :warning  throttled-emailer)
        (with :state :ok       throttled-emailer)))

But with pipe, we can write:

(pipe - (splitp &lt; metric
                0.9 (with :state :critical -)
                0.5 (with :state :warning  -)
                    (with :state :ok       -))
        (throttle 100 1 (email &quot;ops@rickenbacker.mil&quot;)))

So pipe lets us do three things:

0. *Flatten* a deeply nested expression, like Clojure's -&gt; and -&gt;&gt;.

1. *Omit or simplify* the names for each stage, when we care more about the
*structure* of the streams than giving them full descriptions.

2. Write the stream in the *order in which events flow*.

Pipe rewrites its stages as a let binding in reverse order; binding each
stage to the placeholder in turn. The placeholder must be a compile-time
symbol, and obeys the usual let-binding rules about variable shadowing; you
can rebind the marker lexically within any stage using let, etc. Yep, this is
a swiss arrow in disguise; ssshhhhhhh. ;-)</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-project"><h3>project</h3><div class="usage"><code>(project basis &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">Projects an event stream into a specific basis--like (coalesce), but where
you only want to compare two or three specific events. Takes a vector of
predicate expressions, like those used in (where). Project maintains a vector
of the most recent event for each predicate. An incoming event is compared
against each predicate; if it matches, the event replaces any previous event
in that position and the entire vector of events is forwarded to all child
streams. Expired events are included in the emitted vector of events *once*,
and removed from the state vector thereafter.

Use project when you want to compare a small number of distinct states over
time. For instance, to find the ratio of enqueues to dequeues:

(project [(service &quot;enqueues&quot;)
          (service &quot;dequeues&quot;)]
  (smap folds/quotient
    (with :service &quot;enqueues per dequeue&quot;
      ...)))

Here we've combined separate events--enqueues and dequeues--into a single
event, using the folds/quotient function, which divides the first event's
metric by the second. Then we assigned a new service name to that resulting
event, and could subsequently filter based on the metric, assign different
states, graph, alert, etc.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-project*"><h3>project*</h3><div class="usage"><code>(project* predicates &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">Like project, but takes predicate *functions* instead of where expressions.

(where* (fn [e] (&lt; 2 (:metric e))) prn)

(where* expired?
  (partial prn &quot;Expired&quot;)
  (else
    (partial prn &quot;Not expired!&quot;)))</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-where-partition-clauses"><h3>where-partition-clauses</h3><div class="usage"><code>(where-partition-clauses exprs)</code></div><pre class="doc">Given expressions like (a (else b) c (else d)), returns [[a c] [b d]]

other instance of metric with (:metric event). Does the same for host,
service, event, state, time, ttl, tags (which performs an exact match of the
tag vector), tagged (which checks to see if the given tag is present at all),
metric_f, and description.</pre></div><div class="public" id="var-window"><h3>window</h3><div class="usage"><code>(window n &amp; children)</code></div><pre class="doc">Alias for moving-event-window.

Riemann, events are immutable; only this stream's children will see this
version of the event.

If you only want to set *default* values, use `default`. If you want to
update values for a key based on the *current value* of that field in each
event, use `adjust`. If you want to update events using arbitrary functions,
use `smap`.
